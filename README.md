# To the glory of the great North Korea *by Jonasz Kądziela*

## A few words of introduction:
A game made for Ludum Dare 40 competition in 72 hours.
This is my first Ludum Dare, that is why I decided to create a pretty standard game.
It is a tower defence style game inspired by [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/user/Brackeys) tutorials.
